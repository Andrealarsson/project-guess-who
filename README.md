# Guess who?
The assignment was to build the game: Guess who?

## The problem
I thought this weeks project was hard because i havn't understand the pattern of javascript yet. I got help from my team in Slack, on StackPerflow and google. I followd the hints and tips in the project brief to complete the project. When I know more i can definitly add more on my game.
